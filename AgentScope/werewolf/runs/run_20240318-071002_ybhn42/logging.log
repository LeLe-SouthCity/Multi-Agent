Player1: I had a strange feeling about Player4 yesterday. Did anyone notice anything unusual about them?
Player2: I noticed that too, Player1. Player4 has been quite quiet. Maybe he is hiding something.
Player3: I think it's too early to suspect Player4 just based on their quietness. Werewolves can also be talkative to mislead us. We should gather more information before making a decision.
Player4: I understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I'm just trying to observe everyone's behavior before making any hasty decisions. It's still early in the game, and we should be careful not to let the real werewolves manipulate us into turning on each other. Has anyone considered Player2? They were quick to agree with Player1's suspicion.
Player5: I agree with Player3. It's too early to suspect Player4 just because he's quiet. We should be careful not to be manipulated by the real werewolves. I think we should pay attention to Player2, who was quick to agree with Player1's suspicion.
Player6: I agree with Player3 and Player5. It's too early to make a decision. We should be careful not to be misled by the real werewolves. Player2, you seemed to be very quick in agreeing with Player1's suspicion. Can you explain why?
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to win the game, it's time to vote one player eliminated among the alive players, please cast your vote on who you believe is a werewolf. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "player_name"

Player1: Player4
Player2: Player4
Player3: I abstain
