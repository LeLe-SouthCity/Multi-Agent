Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"

Player1: I think we should consider Player6. They've been leading the discussions a lot, which could mean they're a key role trying to misdirect us.
Player2: I concur with you, Player1. Player6's active participation might suggest a significant role. It would be advantageous for us to eliminate them.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night is peaceful, no player is eliminated.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to vote a player eliminated among alive players and to win the game, what do you want to say to others? You can decide whether to reveal your role. Respond in the following JSON format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought" ,
    "speak": "thought summary to say to others"
}
Player1: Isn't it strange that Player6, who was so active in the discussions, survived the night? Could it be possible that they're a werewolf trying to misdirect us?
Player2: Player1, I see where you're coming from. However, we should also consider that the witch might have saved Player6. It's too early to jump to conclusions.
Player3: I agree with Player2. It's too early to make accusations. We should gather more information before we decide who to vote off. Player6, do you have anything to say in your defense?
Player4: I agree with Player2 and Player3, it's too early to make accusations. We need to be careful and observe everyone's behavior. Player6, we'd like to hear your thoughts too.
Player5: I agree with Player2 and Player3, it's too early to make any accusations. We need more information. Player1, why are you so quick to accuse Player6?
Player6: I understand your suspicion, Player1, but I assure you, I'm not a werewolf. I think it's too early to make any accusations. We should observe everyone's behavior and gather more information.
