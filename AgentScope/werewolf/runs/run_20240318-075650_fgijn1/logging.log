    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say to others",
    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"
}
Player1: Player2, I think we should consider Player3. They've been pretty quiet, which could mean they're trying to stay under the radar. What do you think?
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Player3 has been unusually quiet. I think it's a good idea to target them.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night is peaceful, no player is eliminated.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6.

Player1: Wow, it seems like we had a lucky escape last night. I'm glad everyone is safe. We need to be careful and find the werewolves soon.
Player2: That was a close one. I'm glad we're all still here. We should start discussing our suspicions. Does anyone have any leads or suspicions?
Player3: I agree with both of you. We need to start discussing who we think might be the werewolves. Does anyone have any suspicions or information that might help us figure it out? But remember, we should be careful about revealing too much about our own roles.
Player4: I agree with all of you. We need to start discussing and identifying the werewolves among us. At this point, I don't have any specific suspicions, but I believe if we share our thoughts and observations, we might be able to figure out who the werewolves are. Let's be careful and strategic in our discussions.
Player5: I agree with everyone. We need to start discussing and figuring out who the werewolves might be. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but we should all be careful and strategic in our discussions.
Player6: I agree with everyone. We need to start discussing and figuring out who the werewolves might be. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but we should all be careful and strategic in our discussions.
