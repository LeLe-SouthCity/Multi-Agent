    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say to others",
    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"
}
Player1: I have been observing everyone's behavior. I think Player3 is acting a bit strange. What do you think, Player2?
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. I've also noticed some odd behavior from Player3. Let's target Player3 tonight.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{{
   "thought": "thought" ,
   "speak": "player_name"

Player1: Player3
Player2: Player3
Moderator: The player with the most votes is Player3.
Moderator: Player6, you're the witch. Tonight Player3 is eliminated. Would you like to resurrect Player3? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say",
    "resurrect": true/false

Player6: I have a strong feeling that we should keep Player3 around. He could be crucial in helping us find the werewolves.
Moderator: Player5, you're the seer. Which player in Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6 would you like to check tonight? Respond in the following json format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Player5: Player1
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night is peaceful, no player is eliminated.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to vote a player eliminated among alive players and to win the game, what do you want to say to others? You can decide whether to reveal your role. Respond in the following JSON format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought" ,
    "speak": "thought summary to say to others"
}
Player1: I'm glad no one was eliminated last night. It seems like we have a very vigilant witch among us. I've been observing everyone's behavior and I have some doubts about Player4. He was very quiet yesterday which is quite unusual. What do you guys think?
