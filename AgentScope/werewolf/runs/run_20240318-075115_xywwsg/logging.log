Player1: I can't believe Player4 was eliminated. They seemed so sure of their theories. Does anyone have any thoughts on who the werewolves might be?
Player2: I'm just as shocked about Player4. I've been observing Player3 and Player5, they've been quite silent. Maybe they are trying to avoid attention?
Player3: I'm just as shocked about Player4 as everyone else. Maybe I've been quiet because I'm trying to observe and make sense of the situation. Player2, you've been quick to point fingers. And Player6, you've been unusually quiet too. What's your defense?
Player5: I agree with Player3. Player2 was quick to point fingers, and Player6 has been unusually quiet. We should all share our observations and thoughts, not just point fingers.
Player6: I agree with Player5. We should all share our thoughts and not just point fingers. I've been quiet because I'm trying to observe and understand the situation. As for Player2 and Player3, I've noticed some tension between you two. Is there something you're not telling us?
