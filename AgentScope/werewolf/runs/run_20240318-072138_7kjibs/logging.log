Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say to others",
    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"
}
Player1: I think we should consider Player3. They haven't contributed much to the discussion.
Player2: I see your point about Player3, but I have my suspicions about Player4. They seem to be very observant, which could be a threat to us.
Player1: You're right, Player2. Player4 does seem quite observant. But don't you think Player3's silence is also suspicious?
Player2: I agree that Player3's silence is suspicious, but I still think Player4 is more of a threat. They're very observant and could potentially uncover our identities.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Moderator: The player with the most votes is Player4.

    "resurrect": true/false

Player6: I'm deeply saddened by the loss of Player4, but I believe it's too early for any drastic actions. We must stay strong and continue to find out who the werewolves are.
