Player1: I can't believe Player3 is gone, they were such a strong player. Did anyone notice any suspicious behavior from Player4? They've been pretty quiet.
Player2: I also noticed that Player4 has been quiet. Maybe they are trying to avoid attention? But we shouldn't jump to conclusions, it's just a suspicion.
Player4: I understand your suspicion towards me because I've been quiet. However, I assure you that I'm a villager. I've been quiet because I'm trying to observe everyone's behavior. Has anyone else noticed anything suspicious? We need to work together to find the werewolves.
Player5: I'm also saddened to see Player3 go. I've been observing everyone's behavior, and I also think Player4 has been a bit quiet. But, we should be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's continue to observe and gather more information.
Player6: I agree with what everyone is saying. We need to be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. Being quiet doesn't necessarily mean Player4 is a werewolf. He could be observing everyone's behavior like he said. Let's continue to observe and gather more information.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to win the game, it's time to vote one player eliminated among the alive players, please cast your vote on who you believe is a werewolf.
