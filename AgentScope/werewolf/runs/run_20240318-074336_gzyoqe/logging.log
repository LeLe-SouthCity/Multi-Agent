Player1: I've noticed that Player4 has been acting a bit unusual. I think we should consider them as a potential werewolf.
Player2: I agree with Player1. I've also noticed some strange behavior from Player4.
Player4: I understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I'm not a werewolf. I've been trying to figure out who the werewolves might be just like all of you. I think we should focus on the players who haven't said much yet, like Player5 and Player6. They've been awfully quiet.
Player5: I'm sorry for not speaking up earlier. I've been trying to observe everyone's behavior. I agree with Player4, it's important to pay attention to everyone, not just those who are speaking the most. I also want to point out that Player3's elimination was a loss for us. I believe they were not a werewolf.
