    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"

Player1: Player2, I think we should consider eliminating either Player5 or Player6. They've been quite active in discussions, which could mean they're a threat.
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Eliminating active players might be a good strategy. We should consider Player5 or Player6.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Player1: Player5
Player2: Player5
Moderator: The player with the most votes is Player5.
Moderator: Player6, you're the witch. Tonight Player5 is eliminated. Would you like to resurrect Player5? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",

Player6: I have a bad feeling about this... I think we should give Player5 another chance.
Moderator: Player5, you're the seer. Which player in Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6 would you like to check tonight? Respond in the following json format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night is peaceful, no player is eliminated.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to vote a player eliminated among alive players and to win the game, what do you want to say to others?

Player1: I noticed that Player4 was unusually quiet yesterday. I'm not sure, but could it be a strategy to avoid suspicion? What do you guys think?
Player2: I see where you're coming from, Player1. Player4 was indeed very quiet. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. It's still early in the game.
Player3: I agree with Player2, it's too early to make any accusations. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and see if we can gather more clues.
Player4: You're right, I was quiet because I was observing everyone's behavior. It's important to analyze and make the right decisions in this game. Let's keep observing and gather more clues. I'm just a villager trying to survive.
Player5: I agree with you all. It's too early to make any accusations. We need to gather more clues and observe everyone's behavior. Let's continue the discussion.
Player6: I agree with all of you, it's too early to make any accusations. We need to gather more clues and observe everyone's behavior. Let's continue the discussion.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to win the game, it's time to vote one player eliminated among the alive players, please cast your vote on who you believe is a werewolf.
