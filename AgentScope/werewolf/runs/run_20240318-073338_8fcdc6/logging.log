Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say to others",
    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"
}
Player1: I think we should focus on the players who are actively participating in the discussions. They could be trying to figure out who we are.
Player2: I think you're onto something, Player1. It's always good to keep an eye on the active ones. But let's not forget the quiet ones either. They might be observing and gathering information.
Player1: I think we should be careful about both the active and quiet players. Both could be a threat in their own way.
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. The active ones might be a bigger threat at the moment. They could be trying to figure out our identities. We should eliminate one of them first.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Player1: Player3
Player2: Player3
Moderator: The player with the most votes is Player3.
Moderator: Player6, you're the witch. Tonight Player3 is eliminated. Would you like to resurrect Player3? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say",
    "resurrect": true/false
}
Player6: I have a strange feeling about this night, but I can't put my finger on it.
