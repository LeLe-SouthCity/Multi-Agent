Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Player1: I think Player4 has been a bit too active in our discussions. It's like they're trying to gather information or something. What do you think, Player2?
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Player4 has indeed been quite active in our discussions. It seems like they're trying to probe too much.
Moderator: Which player do you vote to kill? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{{

Player1: Player4
Player2: Player4
Moderator: The player with the most votes is Player4.
Moderator: Player6, you're the witch. Tonight Player4 is eliminated. Would you like to resurrect Player4? Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say",
    "resurrect": true/false
}
Player6: I have a feeling we shouldn't let Player4 go just yet. There's something about Player4's contributions that makes me think we need them in the game.
Moderator: Player5, you're the seer. Which player in Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6 would you like to check tonight? Respond in the following json format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought" ,
    "speak": "player_name"
}
Player5: Player3
Moderator: Okay, the role of Player3 is a villager.
Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night is peaceful, no player is eliminated.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to vote a player eliminated among alive players and to win the game, what do you want to say to others? You can decide whether to reveal your role. Respond in the following JSON format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought" ,
    "speak": "thought summary to say to others"
}
Player1: I'm glad that we all made it through the night. It's strange that no one was eliminated though. Could it be that the witch saved someone? Anyway, I think we should focus on figuring out who the werewolves are. Does anyone have any suspicions?
Player2: I agree with Player1. It's indeed strange that no one was eliminated. Maybe the witch did save someone. As for suspicions, I'm not sure yet, but I feel like Player3 has been a bit too quiet. What do you guys think?
Player3: It's true that I haven't said much, but I've been trying to observe everyone's behavior. It's too early to make any conclusions, but I agree that we need to find the werewolves as soon as possible.
Player4: I think it's too early to suspect Player3 just because they've been quiet. We don't have much information to go on yet. It's possible that the witch saved someone, but it's also possible that the werewolves decided not to eliminate anyone to confuse us. Let's be careful not to jump to conclusions without evidence.
Player5: I agree with Player4. It's too early to suspect Player3 just because he's been quiet. Let's not rush to judgement without solid evidence. We should focus on finding the werewolves instead.
Player6: I agree with Player4 and Player5. It's too early to suspect anyone without solid evidence. We should focus on finding the werewolves instead. Let's not rush to judgement.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 and Player6.
