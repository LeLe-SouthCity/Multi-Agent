Player1: Player2, I think Player3 is a good target. They've been quite silent, which could mean they're hiding something. What do you think?

Player1: I've noticed that Player4 has been acting quite suspiciously. They've been very defensive, which could indicate they're a werewolf. What do you all think?
Player2: I agree with Player1, Player4 has been acting a bit strange. But we need to be careful and gather more evidence before jumping to conclusions.
Player4: I understand why you might think I'm acting suspiciously, but I assure you, I'm not a werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who is. It seems a bit convenient that Player1 and Player2 are so quick to accuse me. Could it be that you two are the werewolves trying to divert attention from yourselves?
Player5: I agree with Player4. It's strange that Player1 and Player2 are so quick to accuse. Maybe we should consider them as suspects too.
Player6: I think we should be careful before jumping to conclusions. It's possible that Player1 and Player2 are trying to divert attention from themselves, or Player4 and Player5 are working together. Let's observe more before making a decision.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5 and Player6.
