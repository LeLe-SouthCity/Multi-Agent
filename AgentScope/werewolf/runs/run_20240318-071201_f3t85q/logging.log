Player1: I think we should consider Player3. They've been awfully quiet.
Player2: I concur with your observation, Player1. Player3's silence is indeed suspicious. They might be trying to fly under the radar.

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player3 is a villager.
Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night, the following player(s) has been eliminated: Player3.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5 and Player6.

Player1: I've noticed that Player4 has been acting a bit odd. They've been very defensive, which could mean that they're trying to hide something. Maybe we should consider them as a potential werewolf.
Player2: Player1, I see where you're coming from. Player4's defensive behavior could indeed be a sign. But we should also consider other possibilities. Let's not rush with our decisions.
Player4: I understand your suspicion, Player1, but I assure you that I am not a werewolf. I've been defensive because I'm trying to figure out who the werewolves are, just like you. Let's not rush into decisions without concrete evidence.
