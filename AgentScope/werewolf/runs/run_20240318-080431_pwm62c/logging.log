Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()

Player1: I think we should consider Player3. They've been leading the discussions quite a bit, which could be a threat to us. On the other hand, Player4 has been quite quiet. What do you think?
Player2: I agree with you on Player3, their leadership could pose a threat to us. But I also find Player4's silence quite suspicious. They might be trying to stay unnoticed. We should consider both.
Player1: Player2, I think we're on the same page. Both Player3 and Player4 are suspicious. Let's keep an eye on both of them.
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Both Player3 and Player4 seem suspicious and we should keep an eye on both.

Player1: Wow, that was unexpected. I'm glad no one was eliminated last night. But it's strange that Player3 was saved. Does anyone else find that suspicious?
Player2: It's indeed a relief that no one was eliminated last night. But it's a bit puzzling that Player3 was saved. Could it be a strategy or just a coincidence? What do you guys think?
Player3: I'm just as surprised as you all are. I don't understand why I would be saved if I was targeted. Maybe the werewolves are trying to cast suspicion on me. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should consider all possibilities.
Player4: I agree with Player3. It's too early to make any conclusions. We need to gather more information and be careful not to accuse anyone without solid evidence. Let's keep our eyes open and pay attention to everyone's behavior.
Player5: It's indeed strange that no one was eliminated last night. I agree with Player4, we need to gather more information before making any accusations. However, I've noticed that Player1 has been quite silent. Maybe they have something to hide?
Player6: I agree that it's strange Player3 was saved last night, but it could be a coincidence. We shouldn't jump to conclusions. I've noticed that Player1 and Player2 were quick to cast suspicion. Maybe they're trying to divert attention from themselves?
