Moderator: Player1 and Player2, if you are the only werewolf, eliminate a player. Otherwise, discuss with your teammates and reach an agreement. Respond in the following format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought",
    "speak": "thoughts summary to say to others",
    "agreement": "whether the discussion reached an agreement or not(true/false)"
}
Player1: Hey Player2, I think we should consider targeting either Player3 or Player4. They've been pretty quiet, which makes me suspicious. What do you think?
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Player3 and Player4 have been unusually quiet. But we should also consider the possibility that they might be the seer or the witch trying to avoid attention. Let's keep an eye on them for now.
Player1: You're right, Player2. They could be the seer or the witch trying to stay low. Let's be careful and observe them for now.
