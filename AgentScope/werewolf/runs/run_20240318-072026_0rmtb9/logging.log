Player1: Player2, I suggest we consider Player3 or Player4. They seem to be piecing together information quite well, which might pose a threat to us.
Player2: I agree with you, Player1. Player3 and Player4 have been quite active in the discussions. It might be safer for us to eliminate one of them.
Player1: We think Player3 or Player4 might be a threat.
Player2: I think Player3 or Player4 might be a threat.

Moderator: Okay, the role of Player1 is a werewolf.
Moderator: The day is coming, all the players open your eyes. Last night, the following player(s) has been eliminated: Player3.
Moderator: Now the alive players are Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5 and Player6. Given the game rules and your role, based on the situation and the information you gain, to vote a player eliminated among alive players and to win the game, what do you want to say to others? You can decide whether to reveal your role. Respond in the following JSON format which can be loaded by python json.loads()
{
    "thought": "thought" ,
    "speak": "thought summary to say to others"
}
Player1: I'm just a villager, but I have a suspicion about Player4. He's been quite active in the discussions, don't you think? Maybe he's trying to lead us in the wrong direction.
Player2: I agree with Player1. Player4 has been quite active, maybe he's trying to lead us astray. I'm just a villager, but it's just a suspicion.
Player4: I'm just a villager like you guys, I've been active because I want us to win. Player1 and Player2, you're accusing me without any proof. Maybe one of you is the werewolf trying to shift the blame.
Player5: I'm also just a villager. I think Player4 has been active because he's trying to help us win. I have a feeling that Player1 might be a werewolf though. It's just a hunch, but something about his behavior is making me suspicious.
Player6: I agree with Player1 and Player2. Player4 has been quite active, and it could be because he's trying to divert our attention. But I also think we should keep an eye on Player5. He's defending Player4 quite strongly, which could mean that they're both werewolves. Let's be cautious and make our decisions wisely.
